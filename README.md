# Beaver Build
A build system.

## Todo 
- Implement reading config
   - Can be postponed for first project.
   - First project can get away with crawling and searching only cpp and
     hpp files.
- Create project structure tree.
- Research dependency resolution
- Research how to schedule work efficiently
   - Probably have to optimize for critical path
- Create a worker pool to execute
